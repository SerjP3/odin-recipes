    <h3>Decription:</h3>
    <p>Olly makes his favourite Mexican-inspired burgers as a way of saying thank you to his mum for helping him with his
    reading.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>600g sweet potatoes, cut into 1 cm thick chips</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>4 Tesco Finest ultimate brisket & chuck burgers</li>
        <li>60g Tesco Finest vintage Red Leicester bite, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 brioche burger buns, halved horizontally</li>
        <li>4 Little Gem lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>4 tbsp sliced green jalapeños in brine, drained</li>
        <li>about 20 tortilla chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Place the sweet potato fries on a baking tray and drizzle over the olive oil,
        toss to coat then sprinkle over the cayenne pepper. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes until golden.</li>
        <li>To make the guacamole, destone the avocado and spoon the flesh into a bowl. Mash with a fork and stir through the
        coriander and lime juice; set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the pico de gallo, stir the ingredients together in a medium bowl. Season; set aside for 20 mins for the
        flavours to develop.</li>
        <li>To cook the burgers, heat a large griddle or frying pan over a high heat, then reduce heat to medium. Place the burgers
        in the pan and use a spatula to lightly press them down to make full contact. Cook the burgers for 5-6 mins before
        carefully flipping over and pressing down again with the spatula, then cooking for a further 5-6 mins.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the burgers to a baking tray. Top the burgers with cheese and put them in the oven to melt the
        cheese. Carefully wipe the pan clean with kitchen paper and place the burger buns, cut side down, in the pan for 1 min
        to lightly toast.</li>
        <li>Transfer the bun bases to plates and top each with a lettuce leaf, a spoonful of guacamole, a cheeseburger, 1 tbsp
        sliced jalapeños, 4-5 tortilla chips, then 1 heaped tbsp of the pico de gallo. Top with the bun lids and serve with the
        sweet potato fries.</li>
    </ol>
